## Tips

### Tips 1: Import access token to shell environment variables

By running the following command, two environment variables will be declared.
`YAHOO_ACCESS_TOKEN` is for the access token and `YAHOO_REFRESH_TOKEN` is for the refresh token.

```bash
$ eval $(yahoo auth --style=export_env)
```

You would see two environment variables:

```console
$ env | grep YAHOO
YAHOO_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
YAHOO_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
```
